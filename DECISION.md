## OR Build New with Supabase?

If you specifically want Supabase instead of Firebase:

### Pros of Rebuilding:
- PostgreSQL database (more SQL-familiar)
- Supabase auth might be simpler
- Different real-time implementation

### Cons of Rebuilding:
- 2-3 hours of development time
- Your current app is already perfect
- Firebase is proven and working
